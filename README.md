# FlexFun
## Bootstrap inspiration + FlexBox -> BOOM = FlexFun!

So this is my attempt to make CSS a little easier and faster.

### No IE support(who cares)

It doesn't support all browsers(yet).
It was developed in relation with a competition, using firefox.
Making sure it supports Chrome, Firefox and Safari for sure.
